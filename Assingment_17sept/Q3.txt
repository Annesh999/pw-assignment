In web development, accessibility means designing and building websites that can be used by people with various disabilities, including those with visual, hearing, motor, or cognitive impairments. This involves ensuring that all users, regardless of their abilities, can easily navigate, understand, and interact with the content.

Creating accessible websites is essential because it ensures inclusivity, allowing everyone to access information and services online. It benefits different user groups by:

People with Disabilities: It enables users with visual impairments to access content through screen readers, or users with motor impairments to navigate websites using keyboard shortcuts.

Older Adults: Those with age-related impairments can benefit from larger text, clearer navigation, and more accessible designs.

Temporary Impairments: People with short-term disabilities, such as a broken arm, can also benefit from accessible websites.
