
What is SEO and explain the importance of SEO?
SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It's basically the practice of fine-tuning your website to rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs) for relevant searches. The goal is to attract more visitors from organic search traffic, those who find you through search engines without needing paid ads.
 SEO is important:
 
Increased Visibility: Most users never look past the first page of search results. SEO helps your website rank higher, making it more visible to potential customers.

Targeted Traffic: SEO isn't just about ranking high for any search term. It's about attracting users specifically looking for what you offer. This means more qualified leads and better conversion rates.

Credibility: Ranking well on search engines builds trust and credibility for your brand. People tend to view websites at the top of search results as more trustworthy sources.

Cost-Effective: SEO is an ongoing process, but it's a great long-term strategy for organic traffic growth, unlike paid advertising that stops when you stop paying.
