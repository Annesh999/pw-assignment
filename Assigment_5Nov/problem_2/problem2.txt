The comma operator ( , ) in JavaScript is used to separate multiple expressions in a location where a 
single expression is required. It evaluates each expression from left to right and returns the value of the 
last expression.
One common use case for the comma operator is in for loops. 
for(int i=0;j=0;i<10;i++;j++){
    cosole.log(i,j);
}
