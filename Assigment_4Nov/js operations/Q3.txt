Q3. Differentiate between unary, binary, and ternary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.

Unary Operator: Operates on a single operand ( -num, ++num).
Binary Operator: Operates on two operands ( a + b, a - b).
Ternary Operator: Operates on three operands( condition ? expr_if_true : expr_if_false).

Unary operator:
let a=10;
console.log(++a);
console.log(--a);
console.log(a++);
console.log(a--);

Binary operator:
let A=10;
let B=20;
console.log(A+B);
console.log(A-B);
console.log(A*B);
console.log(A/B);

Ternary Operator:
let age = 20;
Ternary operator syntax: condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false
let isAdult = (age >= 18) ? "Yes" : "No";
