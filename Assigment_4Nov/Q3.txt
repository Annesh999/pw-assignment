3: List and describe the five primitive data types in JavaScript.
1.String:

Description: Strings represent sequences of characters and are used to store text.
 Strings are enclosed in single (' '), double (" "), or backticks (` `) quotes.
Example: 
let greeting = 'Hello, World!';


2.Number:
Description: Numbers represent numeric values. JavaScript represents all numbers,
 whether integers or floating-point, using the number type.
Example:
let pi = 3.14159;
let notNumber=NaN;
let num=10;
let positiveInfinity=Infinity;


3.Boolean:
Description: Booleans represent logical values, either true or false. 
They are often used in conditional statements and logical operations.
Example:
let isTrue = true;
let isFalse = false;

4.Null:
Description: Null is a special value representing the intentional absence of any object value. It is a primitive value, and a variable explicitly set to null indicates the absence of a meaningful value.
Example:
let myVar = null;

5.Undefined:
Description: Undefined is a primitive value automatically assigned to variables that have been
 declared but not yet assigned a value. It represents the absence of a value at a specific location in the code.
Example:
let undefinedVar;
