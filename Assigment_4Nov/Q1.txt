Q1. Explain What javascript is and its role in web development?

JavaScript is a high-level scripting language central to web development. Executing in users' browsers, 
it enables dynamic, interactive web pages by manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) and responding to
events. Asynchronous capabilities, AJAX, and frameworks like React or Angular enhance its functionality, 
supporting the creation of seamless, responsive web applications. Additionally, JavaScript has expanded to
server-side development with Node.js, providing a unified language for both client and server tasks. 
Its versatility and widespread use make JavaScript a cornerstone technology for modern, engaging web experiences.
