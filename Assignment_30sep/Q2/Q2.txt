Absolute:-
Absolute positioning refers to a CSS positioning scheme where an element is positioned relative to its closest positioned an ancestor element that has a positioning property other than static, such as relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky.
The element is removed from the normal document flow, and its position is specified using properties like top, right, bottom, and left.
Elements with absolute positioning are not affected by other elements, and they can overlap with other elements if their positions overlap.


Relative:-Relative positioning refers to a CSS positioning scheme where an element is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow.
Unlike absolute positioning, the element's original space in the layout is preserved, and it can be shifted from its normal position using properties like top, right, bottom, and left.
Elements with relative positioning can also affect the positioning of other elements around them.
