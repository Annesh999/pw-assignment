// Q3. What is the same-origin policy in the context of AJAX requests, and how can you work around it?

The same-origin policy is a security feature implemented by web browsers that restricts how a web page
 can make requests to a different domain, protocol, or port from the one it was loaded from. This means
  that an AJAX request from a webpage can only be made to the same domain, protocol, and port as the
   page itself, preventing malicious scripts on one site from accessing sensitive data from another site.

For example, if your web page is loaded from https://www.example.com, you can only make AJAX requests 
to URLs that have the same origin (i.e., the same protocol, domain, and port), 
such as https://www.example.com/api.

using techniques like CORS, JSONP, a proxy server, or an iframe with cross-origin messaging. 
CORS is the most secure and widely used approach for handling cross-origin AJAX requests.
