// List and briefly explain some common Browser APIs available to JavaScript developers.
DOM API:
What it does: Lets you interact with and change the content of a webpage (HTML).
Example: Changing text on a webpage or handling button clicks.
Example code:
javascript
Copy code
document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', () => {
  alert('Button clicked!');
});
2. Fetch API:
What it does: Allows you to get data from the internet (like loading content from a server).
Example: Fetching data from a server.
Example code:
javascript
Copy code
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
  
3. LocalStorage API:
What it does: Lets you store data in the browser that stays even when you refresh the page (permanent until deleted).
Example: Saving a username so it stays after refreshing the page.
Example code:
javascript
Copy code
localStorage.setItem('username', 'john');
console.log(localStorage.getItem('username'));

4. SessionStorage API:
What it does: Similar to LocalStorage, but data only stays for the current session (until you close the tab).
Example: Storing data during a session like a shopping cart.
Example code:
javascript
Copy code
sessionStorage.setItem('cart', JSON.stringify([1, 2, 3]));
console.log(sessionStorage.getItem('cart'));

5. Geolocation API:
What it does: Lets you get the user's location (latitude and longitude).
Example: Finding the user's current location.
Example code:
javascript
Copy code
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(position => {
  console.log(position.coords.latitude, position.coords.longitude);
});

6. Canvas API:
What it does: Lets you draw graphics on the web, like shapes or images.
Example: Drawing a rectangle on the screen.
Example code:
javascript
Copy code
const canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 100, 100); 

7. IndexedDB API:
What it does: Allows you to store large amounts of data locally in the browser (like a database).
Example: Storing user data for an offline app.
Example code: Using IndexedDB to store and retrieve data.

8. WebSockets API:
What it does: Lets you create a real-time connection between the browser and the server (like for chat apps).
Example: Sending and receiving messages in real time.
Example code:
javascript
Copy code
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://example.com/socket');
socket.onmessage = (event) => console.log(event.data);

9. Notification API:
What it does: Lets you show notifications to users, even if they’re not on your webpage.
Example: Sending a push notification.
Example code:
javascript
Copy code
if (Notification.permission === "granted") {
  new Notification("You have a new message!");
}
10. File API:
What it does: Allows you to work with files on the user’s computer (like reading files from an uploaded file input).
Example: Reading a file uploaded by the user.
Example code:
javascript
Copy code
const input = document.getElementById('fileInput');
input.addEventListener('change', () => {
  const file = input.files[0];
  const reader = new FileReader();
  reader.readAsText(file);
  reader.onload = () => console.log(reader.result);
});
